/** This class is intended to efficiently solve graph-search problems using
 * heuristics to determine the best path. To use it, a solution class must be
 * defined
 * so that it contains all the information about any partial or complete
 * solution. Then, a class inheriting from CAStarAlgorithm<Solution class> must
 * also be
 * implemented, overriding five virtual methods which define the behaviour of
 * the solutions. These methods are isSolutionEnded, isSolutionValid,
 * generateChildren, getHeuristic and getCost.
 * Once both classes are generated, each object of the class inheriting from
 * CAStarAlgorithm represents a problem who can be solved by calling
 * getOptimalSolution. See this
 * [A* Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
 * for details about how this algorithm works.
