	/** This class extends `CAbstractNavigator` with the capability of following a list of waypoints. By default, waypoints are followed one by one, 
	 *  but, if they are tagged with `allow_skip=true` **and** the derived navigator class supports it, the navigator may choose to skip some to 
	 *  make a smoother, safer and shorter navigation.
	 *
	 * Waypoints have an optional `target_heading` field, which will be honored only for waypoints that are skipped, and if the underlying robot 
	 * interface supports the pure-rotation methods.
	 *
	 * Notes on navigation status and event dispatchment:
	 *  - Navigation state may briefly pass by the `IDLE` status between a waypoint is reached and a new navigation command is issued towards the next waypoint.
	 *  - `sendNavigationEndEvent()` will be called only when the last waypoint is reached.
	 *  - Reaching an intermediary waypoint (or skipping it if considered so by the navigator) generates a call to `sendWaypointReachedEvent()` instead.
	 *
	 * \sa Base class CAbstractNavigator, CWaypointsNavigator::navigateWaypoints(), and derived classes.
