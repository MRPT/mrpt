Calculates a best-fit image transform from image feature correspondences

model fitting with applications to image analysis and automated cartography.

@param features an array of features; only features with a non-NULL match
	of type \a mtype are used in homography computation
@param n number of features in \a feat
@param mtype determines which of each feature's match fields to use
	for transform computation; should be one of FEATURE_FWD_MATCH,
	FEATURE_BCK_MATCH, or FEATURE_MDL_MATCH; if this is FEATURE_MDL_MATCH,
	correspondences are assumed to be between a feature's img_pt field
	and its match's mdl_pt field, otherwise correspondences are assumed to
	be between the the feature's img_pt field and its match's img_pt field
@param xform_fn pointer to the function used to compute the desired
	transformation from feature correspondences
@param m minimum number of correspondences necessary to instantiate the
	transform computed by \a xform_fn
@param p_badxform desired probability that the final transformation
	returned by RANSAC is corrupted by outliers (i.e. the probability that
	no samples of all inliers were drawn)
@param err_fn pointer to the function used to compute a measure of error
	between putative correspondences for a given transform
@param err_tol correspondences within this distance of each other are
	considered as inliers for a given transform
@param inliers if not nullptr, output as an array of pointers to the final
	set of inliers
@param n_in if not nullptr, output as the final number of inliers

@return Returns a transformation matrix computed using RANSAC or NULL
	on error or if an acceptable transform could not be computed.
