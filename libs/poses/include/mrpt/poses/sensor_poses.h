/** Utility to parse a YAML file with the extrinsic calibration of sensors.
 *
 *  Each YAML map entry defines a sensorLabel, and for each one an `extrinsics`
 *  map containing the SE(3) relative pose between the `parent` frame and this
 *  sensor. The pose is given as a quaternion and a translation.
 *
 *  The expected file contents is like:
 *
 *  \verbatim
 *  # My YAML file:
 *  sensors:  # Note: sensor_poses_from_yaml() expects **this node** as input
 *    camera:
 *      extrinsics:
 *        quaternion: [qx, qy, qz, qw]
 *        translation: [tx, ty, tz]
 *    parent: base_link
 *    imu:
 *      extrinsics:
 *        quaternion: [qx, qy, qz, qw]
 *        translation: [tx, ty, tz]
 *    parent: camera
 *  \endverbatim
 *
 * Following the common ROS conventions, the robot reference frame is assumed
 * to be `base_link` (default).
 *
 * Of course, this mechanism of defining a tree of sensor poses in a YAML file
 * only works for static (rigid) sensor assemblies, where the transformations
 * between them is always static.
 *
 * The data is returned as a `std::map` from sensor labels to poses within the
 * robot reference frame.
 *
 * This function takes as input the YAML filename to load.
 *
 * \sa CPose3D, mrpt::obs::CObservation, sensor_poses_from_yaml()
