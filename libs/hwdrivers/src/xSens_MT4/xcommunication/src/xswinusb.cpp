/*! \brief Sets the policy for a specific pipe associated with an endpoint on

	\param[in]	InterfaceHandle	An initialized usb handle, see \a Initialize.

   a direction bit. This parameter corresponds to the bEndpointAddress field in
   the endpoint descriptor.
	\param[in]	PolicyType	A UINT variable that specifies the policy

				See the remarks section for information about each of the pipe

   description of the PolicyType parameter.

	\remarks
	The following list describes symbolic constants for \a PolicyType

	- SHORT_PACKET_TERMINATE (0x01)
		- The default value is FALSE.
		- To enable SHORT_PACKET_TERMINATE, in Value pass the address of a
   caller-allocated UCHAR variable set to TRUE (nonzero).
		- Enabling SHORT_PACKET_TERMINATE causes the driver to send a
   zero-length packet at the end of every write request to the host controller.

	- AUTO_CLEAR_STALL (0x02)
		- The default value is FALSE. To enable AUTO_CLEAR_STALL, in Value pass
   the address of a caller-allocated UCHAR variable set to TRUE (nonzero).
		- Enabling AUTO_CLEAR_STALL causes winUSB to reset the pipe in order to
   automatically clear the stall condition. Data continues to flow on the bulk
   and interrupt IN endpoints again as soon as a new or a queued transfer
   arrives on the endpoint. This policy parameter does not affect control pipes.
		- Disabling AUTO_CLEAR_STALL causes all transfers (that arrive to the
   endpoint after the stalled transfer) to fail until the caller manually resets
   the endpoint's pipe by calling ResetPipe.

	- PIPE_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT (0x03)
		- The default value is zero. To set a time-out value, in Value pass the
   address of a caller-allocated UINT variable that contains the time-out
   interval.
		- The PIPE_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT value specifies the time-out interval, in
   milliseconds. The host controller cancels transfers that do not complete
   within the specified time-out interval.
		- A value of zero (default) indicates that transfers do not time out
   because the host controller never cancels the transfer.

	- IGNORE_SHORT_PACKETS (0x04)
		- The default value is FALSE. To enable IGNORE_SHORT_PACKETS, in Value
   pass the address of a caller-allocated UCHAR variable set to TRUE (nonzero).
		- Enabling IGNORE_SHORT_PACKETS causes the host controller to not
   complete a read operation after it receives a short packet. Instead, the host
   controller completes the operation only after the host has read the specified
   number of bytes.
		- Disabling IGNORE_SHORT_PACKETS causes the host controller to complete
   a read operation when either the host has read the specified number of bytes
   or the host has received a short packet.

	- ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS (0x05)
		- The default value is TRUE (nonzero). To disable ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS,
   in Value pass the address of a caller-allocated UCHAR variable set to FALSE
   (zero).
		- Disabling ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS causes the read requests to fail
   whenever the device returns more data (on bulk and interrupt IN endpoints)
   than the caller requested.
		- Enabling ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS causes winUSB to save or discard the
   extra data when the device returns more data (on bulk and interrupt IN
   endpoints) than the caller requested. This behavior is defined by setting the
   AUTO_FLUSH value.

	- AUTO_FLUSH (0x06)
		- The default value is FALSE (zero). To enable AUTO_FLUSH, in Value pass
   the address of a caller-allocated UCHAR variable set to TRUE (nonzero).
		- AUTO_FLUSH must be used with ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS enabled. If
   ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS is TRUE, the value of AUTO_FLUSH determines the action
   taken by winUSB when the device returns more data than the caller requested.
		- Disabling ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS causes winUSB to ignore the AUTO_FLUSH
   value.
		- Disabling AUTO_FLUSH with ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS enabled causes winUSB to
   save the extra data, add the data to the beginning of the caller's next read
   request, and send it to the caller in the next read operation.
		- Enabling AUTO_FLUSH with ALLOW_PARTIAL_READS enabled causes winUSB to
   discard the extra data remaining from the read request.

	- RAW_IO (0x07)
		- The default value is FALSE (zero). To enable RAW_IO, in Value pass the
   address of a caller-allocated UCHAR variable set to TRUE (nonzero).
		- Enabling RAW_IO causes winUSB to send data directly to the USB driver
   stack, bypassing winUSB's queuing and error handling mechanism.
		- The buffers that are passed to \a ReadPipe must be configured by the
   caller as follows:
		- The buffer length must be a multiple of the maximum endpoint packet
   size.
		- The length must be less than or equal to the value of
   MAXIMUM_TRANSFER_SIZE retrieved by GetPipePolicy.
		- Disabling RAW_IO (FALSE) does not impose any restriction on the
   buffers that are passed to \a ReadPipe.

	- RESET_PIPE_ON_RESUME (0x09)
		- The default value is FALSE (zero). To enable RESET_PIPE_ON_RESUME, in
   Value pass the address of a caller-allocated UCHAR variable set to TRUE
   (nonzero).
		- TRUE (or a nonzero value) indicates that on resume from suspend,
   winUSB resets the endpoint before it allows the caller to send new requests
   to the endpoint.

/*! \brief Sets the power policy for a device.
	The following list summarizes the effects of changes to power management
   states:

	- All pipe handles, interface handles, locks, and alternate settings are
   preserved across power management events.
	- Any transfers that are in progress are suspended when a device transfers
   to a low power state, and they are resumed when the device is restored to a
   working state.
	- The device and system must be in a working state before the client can
   restore a device-specific configuration. Clients can determine whether the
   device and system are in a working state from the WM_POWERBROADCAST message.
	- The client can indicate that an interface is idle by calling \a
   SetPowerPolicy.

	\param[in]	InterfaceHandle	An initialized usb handle, see \a Initialize.
	\param[in]	PolicyType	A value that specifies the power policy to set.
   The following table describes symbolic constants.
				- AUTO_SUSPEND (0x81)
					- Specifies the auto-suspend policy type; the power policy
   parameter must be specified by the caller in the Value parameter.
					- For auto-suspend, the Value parameter must point to a
   UCHAR variable.
					- If Value is TRUE (nonzero), the USB stack suspends the
   device if the device is idle. A device is idle if there are no transfers
   pending, or if the only pending transfers are IN transfers to interrupt or
   bulk endpoints.
					- The default value is determined by the value set in the
   DefaultIdleState registry setting. By default, this value is TRUE.

				- SUSPEND_DELAY (0x83)
					- Specifies the suspend-delay policy type; the power policy
   parameter must be specified by the caller in the Value parameter.
					- For suspend-delay, Value must point to a UINT variable.
					- Value specifies the minimum amount of time, in
   milliseconds, that the driver must wait post transfer before it can suspend
   the device.
					- The default value is determined by the value set in the
   DefaultIdleTimeout registry setting. By default, this value is five seconds.

	\param[in]	ValueLength	The size, in bytes, of the buffer at Value.
	\param[in]	Value	The new value for the power policy parameter. Data
   type and value for Value depends on the type of power policy passed in
   PolicyType. For more information, see PolicyType.

				- AUTO_SUSPEND (0x81)
					- If the caller specifies a power policy of AUTO_SUSPEND, \a

   Value parameter.
					- If Value is TRUE (that is, nonzero), the USB stack
   suspends the device when no transfers are pending or the only transfers
   pending are IN transfers on an interrupt or bulk endpoint.
					- The value of the DefaultIdleState registry value
   determines the default value of the auto suspend policy parameter.
					- The Value parameter must point to a UCHAR variable.

				- SUSPEND_DELAY (0x83)
					- If the caller specifies a power policy of SUSPEND_DELAY,

					- The suspend delay policy parameter specifies the minimum
   amount of time, in milliseconds, that the driver must wait after any transfer

/*! \brief Retrieves the results of an overlapped operation on the specified
   winUSB handle.

	This function is like the Win32 API routine, GetOverlappedResult, with one
   difference; instead of passing a file handle that is returned from
   CreateFile, the caller passes an interface handle that is returned from \a
   Initialize, or \a GetAssociatedInterface. The caller can use either API
   routine, if the appropriate handle is passed. The \a GetOverlappedResult
   function extracts the file handle from the interface handle and then calls
   GetOverlappedResult.
	The results that are reported by the GetOverlappedResult function are those
   from the specified handle's last overlapped operation to which the specified
   standard windows OVERLAPPED structure was provided, and for which the
   operation's results were pending. A pending operation is indicated when the
   function that started the operation returns FALSE, and the GetLastError
   routine returns ERROR_IO_PENDING. When an I/O operation is pending, the
   function that started the operation resets the hEvent member of the standard
   windows OVERLAPPED structure to the nonsignaled state. Then when the pending
   operation has been completed, the system sets the event object to the
   signaled state.
	The caller can specify that an event object is manually reset in the
   standard windows OVERLAPPED structure. If an automatic reset event object is
   used, the event handle must not be specified in any other wait operation in
   the interval between starting the overlapped operation and the call to \a
   GetOverlappedResult. For example, the event object is sometimes specified in
   one of the wait routines to wait for the operation to be completed. When the
   wait routine returns, the system sets an auto-reset event's state to
   nonsignaled, and a successive call to \a GetOverlappedResult with the bWait
   parameter set to TRUE causes the function to be blocked indefinitely.
	If the bWait parameter is TRUE, GetOverlappedResult determines whether the
   pending operation has been completed by waiting for the event object to be in
   the signaled state.

	If the hEvent member of the standard windows OVERLAPPED structure is
   nullptr, the system uses the state of the file handle to signal when the
   operation has been completed. Do not use file handles for this purpose. It is
   better to use an event object because of the confusion that can occur when
   multiple concurrent overlapped operations are performed on the same file. In
   this situation, you cannot know which operation caused the state of the
   object to be signaled.

	\param[in]	InterfaceHandle	An initialized usb handle, see \a Initialize
	\param[in]	Overlapped	A pointer to a standard windows OVERLAPPED
   structure that was specified when the overlapped operation was started.
	\param[out]	lpNumberOfBytesTransferred	A pointer to a variable that
   receives the number of bytes that were actually transferred by a read or
   write operation.
	\param[in]	bWait	If this parameter is TRUE, the function does not
   return until the operation has been completed. If this parameter is FALSE and
   the operation is still pending, the function returns FALSE and the
   GetLastError function returns ERROR_IO_INCOMPLETE.

	\returns On success, TRUE. Otherwise FALSE. Use GetLastError() to get
   extended error information.
