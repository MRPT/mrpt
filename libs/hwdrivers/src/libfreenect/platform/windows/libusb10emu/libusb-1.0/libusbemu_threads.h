// * Events (Conditional Variables)

#ifdef WIN32
// stick to the Windows scheme for now, but this structure could be easily
// replaced by pthread for portability; however if real-time priority turns
// out to be a requirement on that platform, the pthread implementation may
// not have support for such scheduling.
// for a much more lightweight run-time, this could be replaced by dummy
// objects, provided that the library client is careful enough to avoid any
// sort of race-conditions or dead-locks...
