/**   This "software driver" implements the communication protocol for
 * interfacing a Ultrasonic range finder SRF10 through a custom USB board.
 *
 *   In this class the "bind" is ignored since it is designed for USB
 * connections only, thus it internally generate the required object for
 * simplicity of use.
 *   The serial number of the USB device is used to open it on the first call
 * to "doProcess", thus you must call "loadConfig" before this, or manually
 *     call "setDeviceSerialNumber". The default serial number is "SONAR001"
 *
 * Warning: Avoid defining an object of this class in a global scope if you
 * want to catch all potential
 *      exceptions during the constructors (like USB interface DLL not found,
 * etc...)
 *
 *  \code
 *  PARAMETERS IN THE ".INI"-LIKE CONFIGURATION STRINGS:
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 *   [supplied_section_name]
 *   USB_serialNumber=SONAR001
 *   gain=6			; Value between 0 and 16, for analog gains between 40
 * and 700.
 *   maxRange=4.0		; In meters, used for device internal timer.
 *   minTimeBetweenPings=0.3  ; In seconds
 *
 *   ; The order in which sonars will be fired, indexed by their I2C addresses
 * [0,15]
 *   ;  Up to 16 devices, but you can put any number of devices (from 1 to 16).
