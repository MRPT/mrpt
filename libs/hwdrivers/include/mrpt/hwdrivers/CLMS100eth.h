/** This "software driver" implements the communication protocol for interfacing
 *a SICK LMS100 laser scanners through an ethernet controller.
 *   This class does not need to be bind, i.e. you do not need to call
 *C2DRangeFinderAbstract::bindIO.
 *   Connection is established when user call the turnOn() method. You can
 *pass to the class's constructor the LMS100 's ip address and port.
 *   Device will be configured with the following parameters :
 * - Start Angle : -45 deg (imposed by hardware)
 * - Stop Angle : +225 deg (imposed by hardware)
 * - Apperture : 270 deg (imposed by hardware)
 * - Angular resolution : 0.25 deg
 * - Scan frequency : 25 Hz
 * - Max Range : 20m (imposed by hardware).
 *
 * <b>Important note:</b> SICK LMS 1xx devices have two levels of
 *configuration. In its present implementation, this class only handles one of
 *them, so
 *    <b>before using this class</b>, you must "pre-configure" your scanner
 *with the SICK's software "SOAP" (this software ships with the device),
 *    and set the framerate with this software. Of course, you have to
 *pre-configure the device just once, then save that configuration in its flash
 *memory.
 *
 * To get a laser scan you must proceed like that :
 * \code
 *     CLMS200Eth laser(string("192.168.0.10"), 1234);
 *     laser.turnOn();
 *     bool isOutObs, hardwareError;
 *     CObservation2DRangeScan outObs;
 *     laser.doProcessSimple(isOutObs, outObs, hardwareError);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The sensor pose on the vehicle could be loaded from an ini configuration
 *file with :
 *  \code
 *  PARAMETERS IN THE ".INI"-LIKE CONFIGURATION STRINGS:
 * -------------------------------------------------------
 *   [supplied_section_name]
 *	  ip_address = 192.168.0.50 ;a string wich is the SICK's ip adress
 *(default is 192.168.0.1)
 *   TCP_port = 1234			; an integer value : the tcp ip port on wich the
 *sick is listening (default is 2111).
 *   pose_x=0.21	; Laser range scaner 3D position in the robot (meters)
 *   pose_y=0
 *   pose_z=0.34
 *   pose_yaw=0	; Angles in degrees
 *   pose_pitch=0
 *   pose_roll=0
 *  \endcode
 * This class doesn't configure the SICK LMS sensor, it is recomended to
 *configure the sensor via the
 * the SICK software : SOPAS.
 * \note This class was contributed by Adrien Barral - Robopec (France)
 * \ingroup mrpt_hwdrivers_grp
