/** A `CObservation`-derived class for raw range data from a 2D or 3D
 * rotating scanner. This class is the preferred alternative to
 * CObservationVelodyneScan and CObservation2DRangeScan in MRPT 2.x, since it
 * exposes range data as an organized matrix, more convenient for feature
 * detection directly on "range images".
 * This class can also import data from KITTI dataset-like binary files
 * containing unorganized (non "undistorted", i.e. without compensation for
 * lidar motion) point clouds, which get organized into a 2D range image for
 * easier filtering and postprocessing.
 *
 * Check out the main data fields in the list of members below.
 *
 *  Note that this object has \b two timestamp fields:
 *  - The standard `CObservation::timestamp` field in the base class, which
 * should contain the accurate satellite-based UTC timestamp if available,
 * and
 *  - the field originalReceivedTimestamp, with the
 * local computer-based timestamp based on the reception of the message in
 * the computer.
 *
 *  Both timestamps correspond to the firing of the <b>first</b> laser in
 * the <b>first</b> CObservationRotatingScan::scan_packets packet.
 *
 *  <div align=center> <img src="velodyne_axes.jpg"> </div>
 *
 * API for accurate reconstruction of point clouds from raw range images:
 *  - generatePointCloud()
 *  - generatePointCloudAlongSE3Trajectory()
 *
 * \note New in MRPT 2.0.0
