#  Config file for the `rawlog-grabber` MRPT application.
#  Usage: 
#      rawlog-grabber CONFIG_FILE.ini
#
#  Each section `[XXXXX]` but `[global]` defines a dedicated thread where a 
#  sensor-specific driver runs. Each thread collects observations in parallel 
#  and the main thread sort them by timestamp and dumps them to a RAWLOG file.
#  The driver for each thread is set with the field `driver`, which must
#  match the name of any of the classes in mrpt::hwdrivers implementing 
#  a CGenericSensor.
