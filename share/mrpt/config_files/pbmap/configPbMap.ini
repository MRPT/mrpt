# This config file sets some parameters relative to the pbmap construction (e.g. thresholds
# for plane segmentation, adding color to the planes, detect loop closures while building
# the map, etc). Also, some global variables are set here to switch between sensor and
# rawlog input data. It is read and used by the class PbMapMaker.
