  <summary>Tool for easy calibration of monocular cameras</summary>
  <description>
    <p>This GUI program allows users to find out the camera parameters of a camera by capturing several images of a checkerboard. The program allows online grabbing or images as well as selection of pre-recorded image files. It also shows the reprojected points, undistorted images and a 3D view of the reconstructed camera poses.</p>

    <p>Supported image sources:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> All cameras supported by OpenCV (webcams, firewire,…)</li>
      <li>  All cameras supported by FFmpeg (IP cameras,…)</li>
      <li>  Video files (in any format)</li>

      <li>  The stereo Bumblebee camera, for calibration of the individual cameras one at a time.</li>
      <li>  The intensity channel of a SwisssRanger ToF 3D camera.</li>
      <li>  The RGB intensity and IR channels of Microsoft Kinect.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Precompiled binaries of this application can be found in the Windows packages and Linux repositories.</p>
