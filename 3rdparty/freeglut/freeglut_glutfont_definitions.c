/*
 * This file is necessary for the *nix version of "freeglut" because the
 * original GLUT defined its font variables in rather an unusual way.
 * Publicly, in "glut.h", they were defined as "void *".  Privately,
 * in one of the source code files, they were defined as pointers to a
 * structure.  Most compilers and linkers are satisfied with the "void *"
 * and don't go any farther, but some of them balked.  In particular,
 * when compiling with "freeglut" and then trying to run using the GLUT
 * ".so" library, some of them would give an error.  So we are having to
 * create this file to define the variables as pointers to an unusual
 * structure to match GLUT.
