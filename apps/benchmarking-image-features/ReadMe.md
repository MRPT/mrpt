# GUI App for benchmarking Image detectors and descriptors

This application is a GUI app to benchmark image detectors and descriptors. The performance of the descriptors and detectors will be evaluated in terms of dispersion, computational cost, number of found features, etc.

To run the code follow the instructions:

```
  $ cd PROJECT_DIR
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make 
```
