  - Fix ignored sensorPose of mrpt::obs::CObservationPointCloud while inserting them into voxel maps.

# Version 2.11.1: Released Oct 23rd, 2023
- Changes in libraries:
  - \ref mrpt_math_grp
    - Fix several build warnings introduced in the last version.
  - \ref mrpt_maps_grp
    - Voxel maps: A voxel is considered occupied if its occupancy is larger than `likelihoodOptions.occupiedThreshold` instead of a fixed `0.5`.

# Version 2.11.0: Released Oct 19th, 2023
- Changes in libraries:
  - \ref mrpt_maps_grp
    - New voxel map containers, based on Faconti's [Bonxai](https://github.com/facontidavide/Bonxai) header-only libray (MPL-2.0 license):
      - mrpt::maps::CVoxelMap
      - mrpt::maps::CVoxelMapRGB
      - Example: \ref maps_voxelmap_from_tum_dataset
      - Example: \ref maps_voxelmap_simple
- BUG FIXES:
  - Fix python wrapper FTBFS in armhf and other architectures.

# Version 2.10.2: Released Oct 5th, 2023
- Build system:
  - ROS: fix missing deps in package.xml needed for build via Nix.
  - MRPT and OpenCV versions were until now exposed as macros with 3 hexadecimal digits (e.g. `2.4.0`->`0x240`), with a clear limitation of versions greater than 15. Now, both symbols `MRPT_VERSION` and `MRPT_OPENCV_VERSION_NUM` use TWO hexadecimal digits per version part, like: `2.10.2` -> `0x010A02`, which is much more general and safe for the future. For backwards compatibility, just make sure your user code only uses `MRPT_VERSION>=xxx` or `MRPT_VERSION>xxx` comparisons, instead of less-than comparisons (Fixes [issue #1285](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/1285)).
- Changes in apps:
  - rawlog-edit: Add `--select-label` optional filter to command `--remap-timestamps`.

  - \ref mrpt_base_grp => Refactored into several smaller libraries, one per namespace.
    - Removed class std::vector<std::string>. Replace by STL containers of `std::string` and functions mrpt::system::stringListAsString() in \ref string_manage.
  - \ref mrpt_core_grp  [NEW IN MRPT 2.0.0]
    - Memory alignment of aligned_allocator_cpp11<> is set to 16,32 or 64 depending on whether AVX optimizations are enabled, to be compatible with Eigen.

      - `mrpt::math::make_vector<>` => `std::vector<>{...}` braced initializator
    - Removed the include file: `<mrpt/math/jacobians.h>`. Replace by `<mrpt/math/num_jacobian.h>` or individual methods in \ref mrpt_poses_grp classes.

    - mrpt::slam::CICP API: Simplified and modernized to use only one output parameter, using std::optional.
  - \ref mrpt_system_grp
    - functions to get timestamp as *local* time were removed, since they don't make sense. All timestamps in MRPT are UTC, and they can be formated as dates in either UTC or local time frames.

    - New method: mrpt::obs::CObservation3DRangeScan::rangeImage_getAsImage()
    - Support for multiple-return sensors in mrpt::obs::CObservation3DRangeScan.
    - New NMEA frame class: Message_NMEA_GSA
  - \ref mrpt_poses_grp  [NEW IN MRPT 2.0.0]
    - Reorganized all Lie Algebra methods into \ref mrpt_poses_lie_grp
    - Removed CPose3DRotVec, since its conceptual design is identical to Lie tangent space vectors.

        the mrpt-graphslam lib
      - mrpt::grpahslam::CGraphSlamEngine as the generic object that
         manages graphSLAM, Node/Edge registration decider
         classes under the mrpt::graphslam::deciders namesapce, optimizer
         wrapper classes under mrpt::graphslam::optimizers
  - Changes in build system:
    - [Windows only] `DLL`s/`LIB`s now have the signature
`lib-${name}${2-digits-version}${compiler-name}_{x32|x64}.{dll/lib}`, allowing
several MRPT versions to coexist in the system PATH.
    - [Visual Studio only] There are no longer `pragma comment(lib...)` in
any MRPT header, so it is the user responsibility to correctly tell user
projects to link against MRPT libraries. Normally, this is done with the
standard command `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MYTARGET ${MRPT_LIBS})`.
    - Debian package: depends on libopenni-dev
    - Optional dependency `liblas`: minimum required version is now 1.6.0
(Ubuntu Trusty or above).

a pointcloud in an external container (mrpt::opengl, mrpt::maps)
    - Fix mrpt::hwdrivers::CHokuyoURG can return invalid ray returns as
valid ranges.
    - Fix PTG look-up-tables will always fail to load from cache files and
will re-generate (Closes [GitHub #243](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/243))
    - Fix mrpt::maps::COccupancyGridMap2D::simulateScanRay() fails to mark
out-of-range ranges as "invalid".
    - Fix mrpt::io::CMemoryStream::Clear() after assigning read-only
memory blocks.
    - Fix point into polygon checking not working for concave polygons. Now,
mrpt::math::TPolygon2D::contains() uses the winding number test which works for
any geometry.
    - Fix inconsistent internal state after externalizing
mrpt::obs::CObservation3DRangeScan
    - Fix a long outstanding bug regarding losing of keystroke events in
CDisplayWindow3D windows (Closes #13 again)
    - Fix wrong units for negative numbers in mrpt::system::unitsFormat()
    - Fix potential thread-unsafe conditions while inserting a
mrpt::obs::CObservation2DRangeScan into a pointmap with SSE2 optimizations
enabled.

output of 3D windows (Thanks Mariano J.T. & Christian Kerl from TUM!)
      - Fix typos and wxWidgets align errors in RawLogViewer GUI (Closes
#219)
      - mrpt::nav::CHolonomicND & mrpt::nav::CHolonomicVFF didn't use the

projects</b> missing `using namespace XXX` that might be formerly masked will
now reveal. <b>This is a good thing</b>, though admitedly annoying...
    - New library \ref mrpt_nav_grp, subsumming the old \ref
mrpt_reactivenav_grp.
    - New library \ref mrpt_tfest_grp, a refactor of the old \ref
mrpt_scanmatching_grp.
    - <b>Backwards compatible headers</b> have been provided to ease the
transition of user code for all those library changes. Warning messages will be
shown recommending deprecated replacements.
  - <b>Detailed list of changes:</b>
    - Lib changes:
      - Clean up of the bad practice of `using namespace` in public scopes
of headers. May lead to user code failing for missing `using namespace`s which
were previously masked.
      - Namespace "slam" deprecated in libraries mrpt-obs and mrpt-maps
(used for historical reasons):
        - New namespaces  \ref mrpt_obs_grp and \ref mrpt_maps_grp.
        - #include files moved from old paths <mrpt/slam/...> =>
<mrpt/{obs,maps}/...>
        - Backward compatible headers added in <mrpt/slam/...> until
mrpt 2.0.0
      - New library \ref mrpt_nav_grp, subsumming the old mrpt-reactivenav
(\ref mrpt_reactivenav_grp).
      - \ref mrpt_reactivenav_grp is now a meta-library, depending on \ref
mrpt_nav_grp.
      - \ref mrpt_tfest_grp : Old library mrpt-scanmatching (\ref
mrpt_scanmatching_grp) has been refactored, its API clean-up, and renamed \ref
mrpt_tfest_grp
      - \ref mrpt_scanmatching_grp is now a meta-library, depending on
\ref mrpt_tfest_grp.
      - These classes have been moved between libs for a more sensible
organization:
        - mrpt::slam::CDetectorDoorCrossing ==>
mrpt::detectors::CDetectorDoorCrossing
        - mrpt::slam::CPathPlanningMethod & CPathPlanningCircularRobot:
\ref mrpt_slam_grp ==> \ref mrpt_nav_grp
    - Build System / General changes:
      - Many optimizations in function arguments (value vs ref). Forces
ABI incompatibility with previous versions, hence the change to a new minor
version number.
      - Updated embedded version of Eigen to 3.2.3
      - Kinect: Dropped support for the CL NUI API, which seems
discontinued. Alternatives in use are libfreenect and OpenNI2.
      - libfreenect is now detected in the system and used instead of
compiling the embedded copy of it.
      - Embedded copy of libfreenect has been updated to (23/oct/2014). It
now supports "Kinect for Windows".
      - More selective linking of .so files to avoid useless dependencies
(Fixes #52).
      - (Windows only) MRPT can now be safely built with libusb support
(Freenect, Kinect,...) and it will run on systems without libusb installed, by
means of /DELAYLOAD linking flags.
      - More unit tests.
    - Changes in classes:
      - [mrpt-base]
        - New function mrpt::math::angDistance()
      - [mrpt-hwdrivers]
        - mrpt::hwdrivers::CIMUXSens_MT4: (by Joe Burmeister for Suave
Aerial Software)
          - Upgrade to latest XSens SDK 4.2.1. Requires libudev-dev in
Linux
          - Add GPS observations to CIMUXSens_MT4 for Xsens devices
like GTi-G-700 which have GPS
        - mrpt::hwdrivers::CImageGrabber_dc1394: Length of ring buffer
is now configurable via TCaptureOptions_dc1394::ring_buffer_size
      - [mrpt-maps]
        - Important refactor of internal code related to
mrpt::maps::CMultiMetricMap:
          - All maps (derived from mrpt::maps::CMetricMap) now have a
more uniform interface.
          - Each map now has a `MapDefinition` structure with all its
parameters. See docs for mrpt::maps::TMetricMapInitializer
          - Introduced mrpt::maps::TMapGenericParams to hold
parameters shared in all maps.
      - [mrpt-obs]
        - CObservation::getDescriptionAsText(): New virtual method to
obstain a textual description of observations. Refactoring of messy code
previously in the RawLogViewer app.
      - [mrpt-vision]
        - mrpt::vision::CFeatureExtraction: Removed (unused) optional
ROI parameter in detectors.
    - BUG FIXES:
      - mrpt::poses::CRobot2DPoseEstimator could estimate wrong angular
velocities for orientations near +-180deg.
      - mrpt::system::CDirectoryExplorer::sortByName() didn't sort in
descending order
      - Fixed crashes from MATLAB .mex files:
mrpt::system::registerFatalExceptionHandlers() has no longer effect, and will be
removed in future releases. (Thanks to Jesús Briales García for all the
testing!)
      - Fixed potential crash for Eigen unaligned memory access in 32bit
builds in mrpt::slam::CGridMapAligner and other places ([Closes
#94](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/94))

<hr>
<a name="1.2.0">
  <h2>Version 1.2.0: Released 25-JUN-2014  </h2></a>
  - <b>Most important changes:</b>
    - Public header files (.h) have undergone a serious refactoring to
minimize unnecesary dependencies and reduce compile time and memory as much as
possible. As a side effect, user code might need to add new #include<> lines.
This change justifies the new minor version series 1.2.X.
    - MRPT now cleanly builds in clang and OSX.
    - Support for new camera drivers (OpenNI2, DUO3D).
    - Many bug fixes.

    - Changes in classes:
      - [mrpt-base]
        - Robust kernel templates moved from mrpt::vision to mrpt::math.
See mrpt::math::RobustKernel<>. Added unit tests for robust kernels.
        - mrpt::poses::CPose3D has new SE(3) methods:

        - mrpt::vision::checkerBoardStereoCalibration: More robust
handling of stereo calibration patterns. OpenCV sometimes detects corners in the
wrong order between (left/right) images, so we detect the situation and fix it.
        - mrpt::vision::findMultipleChessboardsCorners():
          - Now enforces a consistent counterclockwise XYZ coordinate
frame at each detected chessboard.

        - mrpt::system::breakpoint()
        - mrpt::vector_float is now mrpt::math::CVectorFloat,
mrpt::vector_double is mrpt::math::CVectorDouble, for name consistency. Also,
using Eigen::VectorXf is preferred for new code.
        - mrpt::CImage::rectifyImage() with parameters as separate
vectors.
        - mrpt::maps::CPointsMap::getPoint() with mrpt::poses::CPoint3D

    - BUG FIXES:
      - RawlogViewer app: Fixed abort while converting SF->obs.only
datasets when there is no odometry.
      - mrpt::obs::CSensoryFrame: The cached point map is now invalidated
with any change to the list of observations so it's rebuild upon next call.
      - New implementation of mrpt::synch::CSemaphore avoids crashes in OS
X - by Randolph Voorhies.
      - mrpt::opengl::CArrow was always drawn of normalized length.
      - FlyCapture2 monocular & stereo cameras could return an incorrect
timestamp (only in Linux?).
      - mrpt::system::createDirectory() returned false (error) when the
directory already existed.
      - mrpt::vision::CStereoRectifyMap::rectify() didn't update the left
& right camera poses inside mrpt::obs::CObservationStereoImages objects while
rectifying.
      - RawLogViewer: Operation "convert to SF format" didn't take into
account odometry observations.

"uint32_t" and "uint64_t" in both 32 and 64bit builds, instead of relying of the
"size_t" type. This was done to fix build errors in some GCC versions under
32bits.
        - mrpt::poses::CPose2D now caches the cos() and sin() of phi,
with a huge performance improvement in most common operations.
      - [mrpt-bayes]
        - mrpt::bayes::CKalmanFilterCapable (and all EKF-SLAM methods

      - [mrpt-graphs]
        - mrpt::graphs::CNetworkOfPoses2D,
mrpt::graphs::CNetworkOfPoses3D,... and so on, are now all typedef's instead of
classes, since serialization is now implemented as pure templatized code, thus
avoiding the need to declare derived auxiliary classes  - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3044" >r3044</a>
      - [mrpt-gui]
        - mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindow3D::addTextMessage() (and other
opengl text routines) now allows drawing text with a shadow effect - <a

format (if liblas is installed in the system, see http://www.liblas.org/ ). See
also the ready-to-use import menu in SceneViewer3D - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3244" >r3244</a>
          - mrpt::maps::CPointsMap::loadLASFile()
          - mrpt::maps::CPointsMap::saveLASFile()
        - Integration of wind measurements in gas-concentration maps (by
Javier G. Monroy) - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3050"
>r3050</a>

clean-up, slight optimizations and a translation of old Spanish names/comments
to English - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2939"
>r2939</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2942"

mrpt::reactivenav::CHolonomicND now have more configurable parameters, loadable
from config files. See their documentation.
        - Repulsive forces from obstacles in
mrpt::reactivenav::CHolonomicVFF are now automatically normalized wrt the
density of the 360deg view of obstacles and forces follow a "1/range" law
instead of the old "exp(-range)".
        - Solved a stability issue in C-S paths, in
mrpt::reactivenav::CPTG_DiffDrive_CS (By Mariano Jaimez Tarifa) - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3085" >r3085</a>

fields in mrpt::reactivenav::CHolonomicVFF (Thanks Mariano for noticing!) - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2953" >r2953</a>
      - [mrpt-reactivenav] Precomputed collision grids could be loaded in
mrpt::reactivenav::CParameterizedTrajectoryGenerator even for different robot
parameters/shape: now it correctly detects such situations and recompute when
needed - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2939" >r2939</a>
- Closes <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/issues/detail?id=33" >#33</a>

cameras, including live Kinect capturing.
  - Removed applications:
    - stereo-calib-gui: it's now superseded by kinect-stereo-gui. The old
command line tool is still useful, so it's still there as the example
"stereo-calib-opencv".
