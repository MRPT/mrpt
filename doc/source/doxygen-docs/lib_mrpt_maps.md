Map representations for localization and SLAM.


# Library mrpt-maps

This library is part of MRPT and can be installed in Debian-based systems with:

		sudo apt install libmrpt-maps-dev

Read also [how to import MRPT into your CMake scripts](mrpt_from_cmake.html).

This library includes (almost) all the maps usable for localization or mapping
in the rest of MRPT classes.

Interesting starting points:
<ul>
<li> To see the list of existing metric maps, see the classes inheriting from
the base virtual mrpt::maps::CMetricMap. <b>Note:</b> There are two special
maps which are not declared here in mrpt-maps, but
in <a href="mrpt-vision.html" >mrpt-vision</a>, due to their
heavy dependence on computer vision functions. </li>
<li> This library also adds new classes to the namespace mrpt::opengl, which
couldn't be included in the library mrpt-opengl due to its heavy dependence on
map classes declared here. The classes are:
mrpt::opengl::CAngularObservationMesh,
mrpt::opengl::CPlanarLaserScan </li>
</ul>

mrpt::maps::CMultiMetricMap provides a versatile container for multiple metric
maps, that behaves as if they were a single metric map. This includes updating
the map contents from observations, fusing the information from all maps while
evaluating an observation likelihood, etc.
