<b>T</b>rans<b>f</b>ormation <b>est</b>imation (tfest): This module provides
functions in charge of solving the optimization problem of aligning a set of 2D
or 3D corresponding points, estimating the optimal transformation between the
two frames of reference.

Note that this does not include the related iterative ICP algorithm (see
mrpt::slam::CICP), included in the library \ref mrpt_slam_grp
