Sensor and hardware-related drivers.



# Library `mrpt-hwdrivers`

This C++ library is part of MRPT and can be installed in Debian-based systems
with:

		sudo apt install libmrpt-hwdrivers-dev

See: \ref mrpt_from_cmake

This namespace includes several hardware-related classes, from serial port
interfaces, USB FTDI chip interfaces, to more complex ones including
handling specific proprietary protocols (SICK lasers, etc.).

See the list of classes in mrpt::hwdrivers and the
<b>list of supported sensors</b>
in <a href="http://www.mrpt.org/Supported_hardware_and_sensors" >this page</a>.
