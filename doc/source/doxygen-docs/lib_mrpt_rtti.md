Runtime Type Information (RTTI) library, providing compiler-independent class
registry, class factory, and inheritance information.

# Library mrpt-rtti
<small> [New in MRPT 2.0.0] </small>

This library is part of MRPT and can be installed in Debian-based systems with:

		sudo apt install libmrpt-rtti-dev

Read also [how to import MRPT into your CMake scripts](mrpt_from_cmake.html).

Any class with RTTI support has to be derived from mrpt::rtti::CObject, either
directly or via a hierarchy of inheriting classes.
Class factory by name enables deserialization of polymorphic classes in the
library \ref mrpt_serialization_grp.

All classes defined in each MRPT module are automatically registered when
loading the module (if dynamically linked).

## Example #1: defining new user classes

See: \ref rtti_example1/test.cpp
\snippet rtti_example1/test.cpp example-define-class
\snippet rtti_example1/test.cpp example-define-class-test
Output:
\include rtti_example1/console-ex1.out

## Example #2: using the class factory

See: \ref rtti_example1/test.cpp
\snippet rtti_example1/test.cpp example-define-class
\snippet rtti_example1/test.cpp example-factory
Output:
\include rtti_example1/console-ex2.out
