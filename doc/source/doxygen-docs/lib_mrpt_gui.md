GUI support: 2D plots (Matlab-like), 3D rendering viewports, etc.

# Library mrpt-gui

This C++ library is part of MRPT and can be installed in Debian-based systems
with:

		sudo apt install libmrpt-gui-dev

Read also [how to import MRPT into your CMake scripts](mrpt_from_cmake.html).

This library provides these classes that represent GUI windows, each having a
specific specialized purpose:

 - mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindow: Displays 2D bitmap images, and
optionally sets of points over them, etc.

 - mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindow3D: A powerful 3D rendering window capable of
displaying a mrpt::opengl::COpenGLScene, or efficiently displaying 2D images
using graphics card acceleration. It features mouse navigation, Alt+Enter
fullscreen switching, multiple viewports, etc. See [this
tutorial](https://www.mrpt.org/Tutorial_3D_Scenes).

 - mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindowPlots: Displays one or more 2D vectorial graphs,
in a manner very similar to MATLAB "plot" commands.

 - mrpt::gui::CDisplayWindowGUI: UI capable of complex controls, subwindows,
menus, etc. powered by the nanogui library.

All these window classes inherits from mrpt::gui::CBaseGUIWindow, which provides
a set of methods and variables common to all the classes. It allow
moving/resizing the windows, polling for key strokes, etc. Note events-driven
applications can be also implemented since it also implements the
mrpt::system::CObservable pattern, emitting events as described in the
description of mrpt::gui::CBaseGUIWindow.

All the classes in this library are in the namespace mrpt::gui
