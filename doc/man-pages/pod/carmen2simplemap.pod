carmen2simplemap - Convert robotic datasets between CARMEN and simplemap formats

=head1 SYNOPSIS

carmen2simplemap  [-z <0: none, 1-9: min-max>] -i I<carmen.log> -o
             I<map.simplemap> [-q] [-w] [--] [--version] [-h]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<carmen2simplemap> is a command-line application to convert a CARMEN robotic 
dataset (with corrected poses already in it) into the "simplemap" file format, 
which can be then used to build metric maps (points, occupancy grids, etc.).

Arguments:

   -z <0: none, 1-9: min-max>,  --compress-level <0: none, 1-9: min-max>
     Output GZ-compress level (optional)

   -i <carmen.log>,  --input <carmen.log>
     (required)  Input dataset (required) (*.log)

   -o <map.simplemap>,  --output <map.simplemap>
     (required)  Output file (*.simplemap)

   -q,  --quiet
     Terse output

   -w,  --overwrite
     Force overwrite target file without prompting.

   --,  --ignore_rest
     Ignores the rest of the labeled arguments following this flag.

   --version
     Displays version information and exits.

   -h,  --help
     Displays usage information and exits.
