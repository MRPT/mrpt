GridmapNavSimul - GUI robot simulation within a gridmap

=head1 SYNOPSIS

GridmapNavSimul 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A GUI application for simulation of robot motion within a simulated environment defined by an 
occupancy grid map. The program simulates noisy odometry and laser measurements and generates
a rawlog which can then be used as the input of SLAM algorithms. A ground truth file is also 
generated.

The robot is controlled with a joystick or the cursor arrow keys.
