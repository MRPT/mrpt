=head1 NAME

grid-matching - Executes occupancy grid matching techniques

=head1 SYNOPSIS

grid-matching --match --map1=I<grid1.simplemap> --map2=I<grid1.simplemap>  [I<options>]
grid-matching --detect-test --map1=I<grid1.simplemap> [I<options>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<grid-matching> is a command-line application which takes two maps as input and computes
a Sum-Of-Gaussians (SOG) density distribution for the 2D transformation between them, if 
they are found to match.
