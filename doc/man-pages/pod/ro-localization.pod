=head1 NAME

ro-localization - Monte-Carlo localization for beacon range-only measurements

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ro-localization I<config_file.ini>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<ro-localization> is a command-line application which processes a rawlog and 
tracks a mobile robot pose from the sequence of odometry and observations. It can also 
perform global localization. 

This program is a specialization of pf-localization, with an extended model to 
cope with unknown, dynamic biases in the beacon ranges. It also shows a real-time 
visualization in 3D of the particles, the beacons, and the measurements.
