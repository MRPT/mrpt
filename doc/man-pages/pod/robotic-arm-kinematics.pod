=head1 NAME

robotic-arm-kinematics - GUI for editing and visualizing Denavit-Hartenberg parameters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

robotic-arm-kinematics

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<robotic-arm-kinematics> is a graphical application with both practical and 
didactic intentions: it can be used to teach and learn the usage of 
Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters to define the kinematic chain of robotic 
manipulators. But it can be also used to define real kinematic chains for 
a subsequent usage within C++ programs.
