DifOdometry-Datasets - DIFODO (visual odometry method) from datasets

=head1 SYNOPSIS

DifOdometry-Datasets  [-h] [-c] [-cc ] [-s] 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This GUI application is designed to test the performance of DIFODO 
(visual odometry method) with the datasets of TUM. 
Only the ground truth and the depth images are used.

A config file can be used to customize the most important parameters of the
method (there is an embedded config file that is loaded by default but you 
should at least change the rawlog file path).
