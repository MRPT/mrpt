<h2>Version 2.0.0: (Under development)  </h2></a>
- <b>Most important changes:</b>
	- MRPT now requires **C++17** to build and use. See this page for a guide to
port existing code to MRPT 2.0: \ref porting_mrpt2
	- Support for old namespaces `mrpt-scanmatching`, `mrpt-reactivenav` is
over.
	- Backwards compatible headers for "maps" and "observations" in mrpt::slam
are removed. They moved to their own namespaces in MRPT v1.3.0 (Jan 2015).
	- All pointer typedefs are now in their respective classes.
	- Using a variant type from the mapbox variant library, and added
serialization with variants(To be replaced by std::variant eventually).

of `std::string` and functions mrpt::system::stringListAsString() in \ref
string_manage.
		- \ref mrpt_core_grp  [NEW IN MRPT 2.0.0]
			- Memory alignment of aligned_allocator_cpp11<> is set to 16,32 or

mrpt::opengl::CAssimpModel as a more powerful alternative.
		- \ref mrpt_slam_grp

			- New mrpt::nav::CWaypointsNavigator interface for waypoint
list-based navigation.
			- [ABI & API change] PTG classes refactored (see new virtual base

type. Old PTGs #6 and #7 have been removed for lack of practical use.
				- New separate classes for PTGs based on numerically-integrated
paths and on closed-form formulations.
				- Old deprecated method of PTGs `lambdaFunction()` removed.
				- Parameters are no longer passed via a
mrpt::system::TParameters class, but via a mrpt::config::CConfigFileBase which

				the mrpt-graphslam lib
			- mrpt::grpahslam::CGraphSlamEngine as the generic object that
			   manages graphSLAM, Node/Edge registration decider
			   classes under the mrpt::graphslam::deciders namesapce, optimizer
			   wrapper classes under mrpt::graphslam::optimizers
	- Changes in build system:
		- [Windows only] `DLL`s/`LIB`s now have the signature
`lib-${name}${2-digits-version}${compiler-name}_{x32|x64}.{dll/lib}`, allowing
several MRPT versions to coexist in the system PATH.
		- [Visual Studio only] There are no longer `pragma comment(lib...)` in
any MRPT header, so it is the user responsibility to correctly tell user
projects to link against MRPT libraries. Normally, this is done with the
standard command `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(MYTARGET ${MRPT_LIBS})`.
		- Debian package: depends on libopenni-dev
		- Optional dependency `liblas`: minimum required version is now 1.6.0
(Ubuntu Trusty or above).

a pointcloud in an external container (mrpt::opengl, mrpt::maps)
		- Fix mrpt::hwdrivers::CHokuyoURG can return invalid ray returns as
valid ranges.
		- Fix PTG look-up-tables will always fail to load from cache files and
will re-generate (Closes [GitHub #243](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/243))
		- Fix mrpt::maps::COccupancyGridMap2D::simulateScanRay() fails to mark
out-of-range ranges as "invalid".
		- Fix mrpt::io::CMemoryStream::Clear() after assigning read-only
memory blocks.
		- Fix point into polygon checking not working for concave polygons. Now,
mrpt::math::TPolygon2D::contains() uses the winding number test which works for
any geometry.
		- Fix inconsistent internal state after externalizing
mrpt::obs::CObservation3DRangeScan
		- Fix a long outstanding bug regarding losing of keystroke events in
CDisplayWindow3D windows (Closes #13 again)
		- Fix wrong units for negative numbers in mrpt::system::unitsFormat()
		- Fix potential thread-unsafe conditions while inserting a
mrpt::obs::CObservation2DRangeScan into a pointmap with SSE2 optimizations
enabled.
		- CStream: Fix memory leak if an exception (e.g. EOF) is found during
object deserialization.
		- Fix a bug in the `onlyUniqueRobust` option for point cloud matching
(affecting CICP, etc.). Thanks [Shuo](https://github.com/ygzhangsoya)!

  <h2>Version 1.3.0: Released 12-JAN-2015 </h2></a>
	- <b>Most important changes:</b>
		- Classes in libraries \ref mrpt_obs_grp and \ref mrpt_maps_grp now
belong to new namespaces (mrpt::obs, mrpt::maps) instead of the old mrpt::slam
		- No more `using namespace`s polute MRPT headers. <b>Errors in user
projects</b> missing `using namespace XXX` that might be formerly masked will
now reveal. <b>This is a good thing</b>, though admitedly annoying...
		- New library \ref mrpt_nav_grp, subsumming the old \ref
mrpt_reactivenav_grp.
		- New library \ref mrpt_tfest_grp, a refactor of the old \ref
mrpt_scanmatching_grp.
		- <b>Backwards compatible headers</b> have been provided to ease the
transition of user code for all those library changes. Warning messages will be
shown recommending deprecated replacements.
	- <b>Detailed list of changes:</b>
		- Lib changes:
			- Clean up of the bad practice of `using namespace` in public scopes
of headers. May lead to user code failing for missing `using namespace`s which
were previously masked.
			- Namespace "slam" deprecated in libraries mrpt-obs and mrpt-maps
(used for historical reasons):
				- New namespaces  \ref mrpt_obs_grp and \ref mrpt_maps_grp.
				- #include files moved from old paths <mrpt/slam/...> =>
<mrpt/{obs,maps}/...>
				- Backward compatible headers added in <mrpt/slam/...> until
mrpt 2.0.0
			- New library \ref mrpt_nav_grp, subsumming the old mrpt-reactivenav
(\ref mrpt_reactivenav_grp).
			- \ref mrpt_reactivenav_grp is now a meta-library, depending on \ref
mrpt_nav_grp.
			- \ref mrpt_tfest_grp : Old library mrpt-scanmatching (\ref
mrpt_scanmatching_grp) has been refactored, its API clean-up, and renamed \ref
mrpt_tfest_grp
			- \ref mrpt_scanmatching_grp is now a meta-library, depending on
\ref mrpt_tfest_grp.
			- These classes have been moved between libs for a more sensible
organization:
				- mrpt::slam::CDetectorDoorCrossing ==>
mrpt::detectors::CDetectorDoorCrossing
				- mrpt::slam::CPathPlanningMethod & CPathPlanningCircularRobot:
\ref mrpt_slam_grp ==> \ref mrpt_nav_grp
		- Build System / General changes:
			- Many optimizations in function arguments (value vs ref). Forces
ABI incompatibility with previous versions, hence the change to a new minor
version number.
			- Updated embedded version of Eigen to 3.2.3
			- Kinect: Dropped support for the CL NUI API, which seems
discontinued. Alternatives in use are libfreenect and OpenNI2.
			- libfreenect is now detected in the system and used instead of
compiling the embedded copy of it.
			- Embedded copy of libfreenect has been updated to (23/oct/2014). It
now supports "Kinect for Windows".
			- More selective linking of .so files to avoid useless dependencies
(Fixes #52).
			- (Windows only) MRPT can now be safely built with libusb support
(Freenect, Kinect,...) and it will run on systems without libusb installed, by
means of /DELAYLOAD linking flags.
			- More unit tests.
		- Changes in classes:
			- [mrpt-base]
				- New function mrpt::math::angDistance()
			- [mrpt-hwdrivers]
				- mrpt::hwdrivers::CIMUXSens_MT4: (by Joe Burmeister for Suave
Aerial Software)

mrpt::maps::CMultiMetricMap:
					- All maps (derived from mrpt::maps::CMetricMap) now have a
more uniform interface.
					- Each map now has a `MapDefinition` structure with all its
parameters. See docs for mrpt::maps::TMetricMapInitializer
					- Introduced mrpt::maps::TMapGenericParams to hold
parameters shared in all maps.
			- [mrpt-obs]
				- CObservation::getDescriptionAsText(): New virtual method to
obstain a textual description of observations. Refactoring of messy code
previously in the RawLogViewer app.
			- [mrpt-vision]
				- mrpt::vision::CFeatureExtraction: Removed (unused) optional
ROI parameter in detectors.
		- BUG FIXES:
			- mrpt::poses::CRobot2DPoseEstimator could estimate wrong angular
velocities for orientations near +-180deg.
			- mrpt::system::CDirectoryExplorer::sortByName() didn't sort in
descending order
			- Fixed crashes from MATLAB .mex files:
mrpt::system::registerFatalExceptionHandlers() has no longer effect, and will be
removed in future releases. (Thanks to Jesús Briales García for all the
testing!)
			- Fixed potential crash for Eigen unaligned memory access in 32bit
builds in mrpt::slam::CGridMapAligner and other places ([Closes
#94](https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/94))

	- <b>Most important changes:</b>
		- Public header files (.h) have undergone a serious refactoring to

				- The main new classes are mrpt::maps::COctoMap &
mrpt::opengl::COctoMapVoxels
				- mrpt::maps::CMultiMetricMap now allows the seamless
integration of octomaps in many MRPT map building or localization algorithms.
				- New example: samples/octomap_simple
		- Changes in classes:
			- [mrpt-base]
				- Eigen::MatrixBase<Derived>::loadFromTextFile(), and all MRPT
derived matrix classes, are now much faster loading huge matrices from text
files - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2997" >r2997</a>
				- The typedef Eigen::MatrixBase<Derived>::typename of MRPT's
plugin to Eigen classes has been REMOVED, to avoid conflicts with some part of
Eigen's sparse classes. Use Matrix::Scalar instead - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3065" >r3065</a>
				- New method mrpt::poses::CPose3DQuat::inverse()
				- New methods mrpt::poses::SE_traits::pseudo_exp()
				- mrpt::system::CTimeLogger:
					- New method mrpt::system::CTimeLogger::getStats() for
programatic execution time stats analysis - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2998" >r2998</a>
					- New method
mrpt::system::CTimeLogger::registerUserMeasure() for making stats of
user-providen values - <a

				- mrpt::containers::CDynamicGrid::setSize() now also accepts a
"fill_value" argument.
				- Added method mrpt::math::TPoint2D::norm() for consistency with
mrpt::math::TPoint3D
				- Better support for saving (and not only loading) plain text
configuration files, including commented files with default values of all
existing parameters: - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2954" >r2954</a>
					- All mrpt::config::CConfigFileBase::write() now have an
extended signature for formatting.
					-
mrpt::config::CLoadableOptions::dumpToTextStreamstd::ostream::Seek() now
supports files larger than 2GB by using uint64_t instead of long (still see
issue report for another patch required for MSVC2010) - (Closes <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/issues/detail?id=39" >issue 39</a>, thanks
Robert Schattschneider) - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3042" >r3042</a>
				- mrpt::typemeta::TTypeName<> moved to its own header
<mrpt/typemeta/TTypeName.h> while refactoring
<mrpt/serialization/CSerializable.h>
- <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3044" >r3044</a>
				- mrpt::config::CConfigFileBase::write() now has signatures for
"uint32_t" and "uint64_t" in both 32 and 64bit builds, instead of relying of the
"size_t" type. This was done to fix build errors in some GCC versions under
32bits.
				- mrpt::poses::CPose2D now caches the cos() and sin() of phi,
with a huge performance improvement in most common operations.
			- [mrpt-bayes]
				- mrpt::bayes::CKalmanFilterCapable (and all EKF-SLAM methods
based on it) are now much faster. The implementation now exploits the sparsity
of the Jacobian (~25% faster in a test 6D EKF-SLAM dataset) - <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3059" >r3059</a>, <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3060" >r3060</a>, <a
href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3061" >r3061</a>
				- mrpt::bayes::CParticleFilterCapable now makes use of the
Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP) design instead of ugly #define
macros - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=3182" >r3182</a>
			- [mrpt-graphs]
				- mrpt::graphs::CNetworkOfPoses2D,
mrpt::graphs::CNetworkOfPoses3D,... and so on, are now all typedef's instead of

parameters/shape: now it correctly detects such situations and recompute when
needed - <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mrpt/source/detail?r=2939" >r2939</a>
