/** \page mrpt_from_cmake Using MRPT from your CMake project

## Finding MRPT from CMake

MRPT defines exported projects that can be imported as usual in modern CMake:

```
# Find MRPT libraries, one by one:
find_package(mrpt-poses)
find_package(mrpt-gui)
# Or the alternative:
#find_package(MRPT 1.9.9 COMPONENTS poses gui OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS vision)


# Define your own targets:
add_executable(myapp  main.cpp)

# Link against MRPT: this will also add all required flags,
# include directories, etc.
target_link_libraries(myapp
  mrpt::poses
  mrpt::gui
)
```

## For MRPT 1.x

Prior to MRPT 2.0.0, the correct way to find for MRPT was different:

```
# Find MRPT libraries:
find_package(MRPT REQUIRED poses gui)

add_executable(myapp  main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myapp ${MRPT_LIBS})
```
