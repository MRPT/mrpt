/** \defgroup mrpt_serialization_grp [mrpt-serialization]

Serialization (marshalling) portable library for C++ objects persistence.

# Library `mrpt-serialization`
<small> [New in MRPT 2.0.0] </small>

This library is part of MRPT and can be installed in Debian-based systems with:

        sudo apt install libmrpt-serialization-dev

Main classes and concepts associated with this library:
- mrpt::serialization::CArchive provides:
	- An abstraction of I/O streams (e.g. std::stream's, MRPT's mrpt::io::CStream's, sockets)
	- A portable API (endianness aware) for serialization of data structures on those streams.
- mrpt::serialization::CSerializable provides:
	- A generic way to define persistent C++ classes.
	- Versioning: if class fields are added or removed, you'll still be able to read old data files.

Serialization happens via `archive << object` operators in all cases but, underneath, two mechanisms are provided:
- **Direct overloading of the `<<`/`>>` operators** for mrpt::serialization::CArchive objects.
	- Pros: concise declaration (just the two operator functions).
	- Cons: Cannot handle versioning. Cannot deserialize unknown types (i.e. no support for class factory).
- **Via mrpt::serialization::CSerializable** and associated macros:
	- Pros: Allows polymorphic classes to be (de)serialized. Allows versioning.
	- Cons: Requires adding macros to class definitions. Requires **registering** the class with \ref mrpt_rtti_grp.

Support for STL containers is provided via this "direct mechanism" for the container structure itself, but contained
elements can use any of the serialization mechanisms.

Serializing `shared_ptr<T>` is supported for any arbitrary type `T`. It is legal to serialize an empty (`nullptr`)
smart pointer; an empty pointer will be read back. Polymorphic classes can be also writen and read, although reading
a smart pointer to a polymorphic base class is only supported for classes derived from MRPT's CSerializable, since
that operation requires registering types in a class factory (see \a mrpt_rtti_grp and mrpt::serialization::CSerializable).

## Example #1: serialize STL container via MRPT `CStream`s

See: \ref serialization_stl/test.cpp
\snippet serialization_stl/test.cpp example
Output:
\include serialization_stl/console.out

## Example #2: serialize STL container via `std::ostream` and `std::istream`

See: \ref serialization_stl/test.cpp
\snippet serialization_stl/test.cpp example_stdio
Output:
\include serialization_stl/console.out

## Example #3: Serialization of existing MRPT classes

Write me!

## Example #4: Polymorphic serialization of user classes

Write me!
