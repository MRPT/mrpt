MRPT includes a C++ platform-independent implementation of the MT19937 algorithm for generating high-quality pseudo-random numbers.
The following example demonstrates:

- The usage of random number generators in MRPT. See mrpt::random for the detailed documentation of C++ classes and methods.
- The class mrpt::math::CHistogram.
- The usage of MATLAB-like plots.
