-----------
* Merge pull request `#1413 <https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/1413>`_ from MRPT/feat/api-cleanups-3.1
  feat: API cleanups before the next minor bump (archives, const-correctness, points-map accessor)
* feat(mrpt_obs,mrpt_viz,mrpt_maps): deep const-correctness in smart-pointer containers
  Reading through a `const` container of `X::Ptr` handed out mutable
  pointees, so constness stopped at the container. Add a small
  `mrpt::containers::deep_const_iterator` proxy and use it for the
  `const_iterator`s of CSensoryFrame, CActionCollection, CSetOfObjects,
  Viewport and CMultiMetricMap: dereferencing them now yields `X::ConstPtr`.
  Also:
  * Scene, Viewport and CSetOfObjects gain const `getByName()` overloads
  returning a ConstPtr, matching the existing getByClass() pairs.
  * CMultiMetricMap::maps is no longer a public member: use push_back(),
  size(), empty(), clearMaps(), mapByIndex(), begin()/end(), or
  mapsList() when direct manipulation of the list is really needed.
  * The mrpt_opengl renderer now keeps `const CVisualObject` handles: it
  was relying on the const-iteration hole, and every method it calls on
  the source objects was already const.
  * observationsOverlap() takes ConstPtr arguments, as it only reads.
  Porting notes added to the MRPT 3 porting guide.
* feat(mrpt_maps): retire CMetricMap::getAsSimplePointsMap()
  The virtual returned a raw pointer that was either `this` or a child map
  owned by a CMultiMetricMap, and it only ever answered for
  CSimplePointsMap: any other points map (CPointsMapXYZI,...) silently got
  a nullptr, which CPointsMap::compute3DMatchingRatio then passed straight
  into determineMatching3D().
  Replace it with a free function in mrpt_maps, `asPointsMap(map)`, which
  returns any points map, or the single child points map of a multi-metric
  map. compute3DMatchingRatio() now uses it and thus works for every points
  map type. Callers wanting ownership should use
  CMultiMetricMap::mapByClass<>() instead, which returns a real Ptr.
