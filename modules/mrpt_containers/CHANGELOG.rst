-----------
* Merge pull request `#1413 <https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/1413>`_ from MRPT/feat/api-cleanups-3.1
  feat: API cleanups before the next minor bump (archives, const-correctness, points-map accessor)
* feat(mrpt_obs,mrpt_viz,mrpt_maps): deep const-correctness in smart-pointer containers
  Reading through a `const` container of `X::Ptr` handed out mutable
  pointees, so constness stopped at the container. Add a small
  `mrpt::containers::deep_const_iterator` proxy and use it for the
  `const_iterator`s of CSensoryFrame, CActionCollection, CSetOfObjects,
  Viewport and CMultiMetricMap: dereferencing them now yields `X::ConstPtr`.
  Also:
  * Scene, Viewport and CSetOfObjects gain const `getByName()` overloads
  returning a ConstPtr, matching the existing getByClass() pairs.
  * CMultiMetricMap::maps is no longer a public member: use push_back(),
  size(), empty(), clearMaps(), mapByIndex(), begin()/end(), or
  mapsList() when direct manipulation of the list is really needed.
  * The mrpt_opengl renderer now keeps `const CVisualObject` handles: it
  was relying on the const-iteration hole, and every method it calls on
  the source objects was already const.
  * observationsOverlap() takes ConstPtr arguments, as it only reads.
  Porting notes added to the MRPT 3 porting guide.
* fix: resolve gcc warnings flagged by the ROS buildfarm (Humble/Jazzy) (`#1412 <https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/1412>`_)
  * fix: resolve gcc warnings flagged across the ROS buildfarm (Humble/Jazzy)
  Addresses every warning category surfaced by the last Humble (Ubuntu
  Jammy, gcc-11) and Jazzy (Ubuntu Noble, gcc-13) ROS buildfarm dev jobs:
  -Wold-style-cast, -Wconversion, -Wsign-conversion, -Wfloat-conversion,
  -Wunused-parameter, -Wunused-result, -Wdeprecated-declarations,
  -Wdangling-else, -Wdangling-reference, -Wnon-virtual-dtor,
  -Woverloaded-virtual, -Wsign-compare, -Wstringop-overread, -Wshadow,
  -Wreturn-local-addr and -Wrange-loop-construct, spanning mrpt_bayes,
  mrpt_containers, mrpt_core, mrpt_graphs, mrpt_graphslam, mrpt_hwdrivers,
  mrpt_img, mrpt_maps, mrpt_math, mrpt_nav, mrpt_obs, mrpt_poses,
  mrpt_serialization, mrpt_slam, mrpt_system and mrpt_viz.
  Real bugs fixed along the way (not just silenced casts):
  * CPose3DQuat::operator[](i) const returned a temporary `double` by
  value while its `const_iterator` bound it to a `const double&`,
  making every dereference of a const iterator dangling
  (-Wreturn-local-addr).
  * CDirectedTree::Visitor and every one of its subclasses had virtual
  functions but a non-virtual destructor.
  * CSerializable's schema-archive overloads of serializeTo/serializeFrom
  were silently hidden in any class using DEFINE_SERIALIZABLE, so they
  were unreachable without explicit qualification; added the missing
  `using` declarations.
  * mrpt::Clock::time_point had no discoverable (ADL-reachable)
  operator<<, which made gtest's EXPECT_EQ/ASSERT_EQ fail to compile
  wherever it compared two timestamps on gcc-11/older libstdc++ (the
  actual Humble build error, not just a warning) -- this was the one
  case where mrpt::system::operator<<(TTimeStamp) already existed but
  lived in a namespace ADL never finds from outside mrpt::system; it is
  now `mrpt::operator<<`, with `mrpt::system` bringing it back in via a
  `using` declaration for existing qualified callers.
  * Several TKFMethod-shaped unscoped enums (TKFMethod,
  TLaserSimulUncertaintyMethod, TMatrixTextFileFormat,
  TICPCovarianceMethod) had no fixed underlying type, so a test
  casting an intentionally-invalid value into them triggered
  "conversion is unspecified" rather than the well-defined reinterpret
  a fixed underlying type gives.
  Everything else is either a widening/narrowing cast made explicit, an
  unused parameter renamed to a comment, `else`-ambiguous one-liners
  given braces, or a documented false-positive (e.g. a wrapper around a
  cached-static-map accessor gcc's -Wdangling-reference still flags)
  resolved by dropping the unnecessary named reference instead of
  suppressing the warning.
  Verified with an incremental colcon build of all 16 touched packages
  under mrpt_common's warning set (-Wall -Wextra -Wshadow -Wtype-limits
  -Wcast-align -Wparentheses -Wunused -Wpedantic -Wconversion
  -Wsign-conversion -Wdouble-promotion -Woverloaded-virtual
  -Wold-style-cast -Wnon-virtual-dtor): zero warnings left other than a
  gcc-13/-O3 -Wmaybe-uninitialized false positive on small fixed-size
  CMatrixDynamic construction that isn't present in either buildfarm log
  and isn't touched by this change. All existing unit tests
  (2000+ cases across the touched packages) still pass.

  * fix: replace the Clock::time_point operator<< with a gtest PrintTo hook
  The operator<<(Clock::time_point) added in the previous commit, found via
  ADL because mrpt::Clock is in namespace mrpt, broke unrelated `os << x`
  calls in any translation unit with several `using namespace mrpt::...;`
  directives active at once (e.g. MonteCarloLocalization_App.cpp, which
  has ~15 of them): overload resolution for `os << particles_count`
  (a std::vector<int>) stopped finding mrpt::math's own
  operator<<(ostream&, const std::vector<T>&) entirely -- this broke all
  four CI compilers (gcc, clang, AppleClang, MSVC), all failing on the
  exact same line.
  It was also never the right fix for a second reason: mrpt::system
  already had an operator<<(TTimeStamp) doing the same thing (TTimeStamp
  being just an alias of Clock::time_point), so having both in scope at
  once was flat-out ambiguous the moment `using namespace mrpt::system;`
  and ADL both applied -- which is exactly the CObservation.cpp failure
  this was meant to fix in the first place.
  gtest's own recommended mechanism for exactly this situation --
  teaching it to print a type it doesn't otherwise know how to -- is a
  `PrintTo(value, ostream*)` overload, looked up via ADL *before* gtest
  falls back to operator<<. It doesn't add anything to the type's normal
  operator<< overload set, so it cannot participate in, or break, any
  unrelated overload resolution. mrpt::system::operator<<(TTimeStamp) is
  reverted to its original, unmodified form.
  Verified with a clean incremental build of all 21 packages (the 16 from
  the previous commit plus mrpt_libapps_gui/_cli, mrpt_gui, mrpt_apps_gui/_cli,
  which pulled in MonteCarloLocalization_App.cpp): zero errors, zero
  warnings. The four originally-affected unit test binaries
  (mrpt_core, mrpt_system, mrpt_containers, mrpt_obs) still pass in full.

------------------
* Merge pull request `#1363 <https://github.com/MRPT/mrpt/issues/1363>`_ from MRPT/fix/dont-export-eigen3-dep
  refactor: limit visibility of eigen3 as build dep
* fix: restore lean libfyaml-core.h include; disable libfyaml tests
  Revert yaml.cpp back to including <libfyaml/libfyaml-core.h> (as in develop)
  instead of the monolithic <libfyaml.h>, which pulls in <stdatomic.h> and
  breaks the C++ build on macOS (<atomic> incompatible with <stdatomic.h>) and
  gcc. The submodule is back on the fork commit that ships libfyaml-core.h.
  Also pass -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF to the embedded libfyaml so it does not
  FetchContent the 'check' test framework (needs network; breaks isolated and
  Debian-package builds).
* submodule: revert libfyaml to fork commit with Windows/macOS fixes
  The previous bump to upstream 9a4d9b2 lost the fork's portability fixes
  (MSVC ssize_t / C++17 atomic fallback) and used cmake_minimum_required(3.0),
  breaking the Windows and macOS CI. Revert to 1ed7581, which builds on all
  platforms (matches develop).
* fix: allow libfyaml to configure with recent CMake (>=4.0)
  The bundled libfyaml uses cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0), which is
  rejected by CMake >=4.0 (macOS/Windows CI runners). Pass
  CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to its ExternalProject configure step.
* submodule: update libfyaml
* fix: KF math errors
