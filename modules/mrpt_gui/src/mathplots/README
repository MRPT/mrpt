0.1.2 Release notes
-------------------
Scrollers back again. Ability to build as DLL in Windows. Introduced colour theme, plus minor fixes.

0.1.1 Release notes
-------------------
Minor bugfixes, introduced show/hide for single layer and added library packaging.

0.1.0 Release notes
-------------------

Library has been deeply revised: the coordinate system has been changed for code simplification. Added a lot of new functionalities:
1. Printing
2. Saving screenshots as images
3. Legend
4. Mouse coordinates display
5. A number of new layer types
6. Optional axis draw margins (to avoid that plots can hide axis labels)
...and a lot of bugfixing! See Changelog for more details.


0.03 Release notes
------------------

Some useful functionalities has been added.
The axes now can be set to be drawn on 5 different configurations for each one. In addition to the central mode prevoiusly avalilable, you can draw them to the the borders of the window, or close to the border but with an offset to let labels within. The axes are now always visible when you resize the window. This style is more similar to technical softwares, and more useful, I think.
Mouse operations are now available for zooming, panning and scrolling the window. You can also activate double buffering of the mpWindow to avoid flickering.
Three new classes are available, mpText, mpProfile and mpFXYVector. See Changelog for more details.

A special acknowledgement goes to the contributors Jose Luis Blanco and Val Greene who provided a significant part of the new functionalities. 

0.02 Release notes
------------------

While the project has been idle for about 4 years, this release simply fixes
some thing to adapt to new versions of wxWidgets. The use of deprecated
classes or method has been corrected. Only a simple method for layer
counting has been added.

wxMathPlot now works on Linux (tested for Mepis 6.5 and Debian Etch using
wxGTK-2.6), and Windows (built under XP using Visual Studio Express 2005).

Installing
----------

wxMathPlot uses cmake build environment
It requires wxWidgets >= 2.6 to be installed.

Under POSIX systems, to build and install wxMathPlot run:

cmake -i .
make
make install

Running cmake with -i option causes to get an interactive shell which asks some question on how to build the library.

Default install directory for headers is:
/usr/local/include

and the lib to
/usr/local/lib

Samples
-------

A subdirectory 'samples' contains sample applications using wxMathLib.
They re built together with the library, if the relative option is selected by CMake.
